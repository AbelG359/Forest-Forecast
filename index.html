            <h1 class="article"> Australian Forest fires</h1>
            <p>     After months of extreme heat and drought in Australia, the fires finally came. Australia experiences bushfires every year. But this year they are particularly extreme — and summer in the southern hemisphere has only just begun.
                Eight million hectares have been destroyed by the flames so far. Twenty-five people and millions of animals have been killed. Entire regions have been left without power and clouds of smoke now cover half the continent, according to the preliminary assessment of the devastating fires.kill 480 million animals, 25 human deaths,
                Australia's catastrophic brush fire season comes as the country continues to insist on a climate loophole that critics say would undermine the Paris Agreement's objective of keeping global warming to relatively safe levels.

            <h1 class="amazon"> Amazon Deforestation & Fires </h1>
            <p class="info2">   Since 1978 over 750,000 square kilometers (289,000 square miles) of Amazon rainforest have been destroyed across Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, Venezuela, Suriname, Guyana, and French Guiana. For most of human history, deforestation in the Amazon was primarily the product of subsistence farmers who cut down trees to produce crops for their families and local consumption. But in the later part of the 20th century, that began to change, with an increasing proportion of deforestation driven by industrial activities and large-scale agriculture. By the 2000s more than three-quarters of forest clearing in the Amazon was for cattle-ranching.
                the country's National Institute for Space Research, or INPE, released data Monday revealing that 3,769 square miles of rainforest were lost to deforestation in a 12-month period ending in July. That marks the highest rate of deforestation since 2008 — and a nearly 30% spike over the rate recorded by INPE during the previous year long span. Amazon precipitation follows a fairly regular cycle, with a summer rainy season and a winter dry season (note that the area in question lies entirely south of 3°S). As has been seen in previous modeling studies [e.g., Henderson‐Sellers et al., 1993], Figure 2 shows that the Amazon suffers a significant decrease in rainy season precipitation when the rain forest is eliminated, while the dry season precipitation experiences little change. The region also sees a reduction in evaporation that lasts throughout the year, with a consequent reduction of latent heat release aloft, possibly generating a propagating signal. Strong annual reductions in total Earth water and total cloud were seen, and a slight increase in summertime surface temperature was realized. We also see a summertime decrease in moisture convergence (as determined by precipitation‐evaporation) and a winter decrease in flux divergence. This suggests that rain forest removal can have effects that extend throughout the atmospheric column and which can occur all year. These results are consistent with what has been seen in the modeling studies described earlier and enhances our confidence in those results.</p>

            <h1 class="Mekong Forest">Mekong Forest:</h1>
            <p class="info">    This makes them an attractive investment for governments seeking to provide for the development needs of their countries, particularly China, and natural resource-based industries keen to meet growing market demand. However, investments have often been short term and exploitative-leaving behind fragmented and degraded forests and watersheds. Only with a carefully managed approach can the delivery of valuable goods and services be sustained over time.Healthy forests are necessary to all aspects of modern life. They store carbon, help protect communities and infrastructure from the impacts of drought and flash-floods, supply clean water and food, livelihoods, materials used in construction, trade, and provide a whole host of other ecological services. The forests of the Greater Mekong - a region encompassing Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Vietnam and Yunnan and Guangxi in Southern China - are some of the most biologically diverse places on Earth. They also contain the largest combined tiger habitat in the world—540,000 km2 or roughly the size of France. But over the last 10 years or so, numbers of this amazing feline have crashed by 70% in this part of the world. More than 70 million people live in Southeast Asia's Mekong region, where trees and forests have multiple benefits for people and biodiversity. Trees lock soils in place, preventing landslides and protecting crops, while forests help regulate rainfall and water cycles. Wood and other forest products provide millions of people with food, materials and economic opportunities in rural communities across Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand. The entire planet relies on the Mekong's forests to store carbon and mitigate climate change. </p>

        <h1 class="CentralAfrica">Central Africa</h1>
        <p class="infor4">The Central African Republic had one of the lowest total deforestation rates among tropical countries between 1990 and 2005 when just 1.9 percent of its forests were lost. However, the country's forest degradation rate was considerably higher due to logging. Today about 16.6 percent of the Central African Republic is under some form of protection, though institutional support for protected areas has historically been weak, and hunters and loggers have continued to operate in national parks. The Central African Republic is home to about 3,600 species of plants, 663 birds, 131 mammals, 187 reptiles, and 29 amphibians. The report, published today (8 June) in the journal Science, highlights the rapid expansion of the logging frontier in the Congo Basin, including Cameroon, Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Republic of Congo and Democratic Republic of Congo. It shows the need to conserve forested landscapes while also sustaining timber production crucial for Central African nations. Central Africa, especially the Democratic Republic of Congo, contains the last frontiers for logging expansion in Africa, Nadine Laporte, a scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center in the United States and one of the authors of the report, told SciDev.Net. In Central Africa as a whole, 600,000 square kilometers of forest –– 30 per cent — has been conceded for logging, whereas only 12 per cent is protected. The highest densities of logging roads are in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, where 15 percent of the forest has been disturbed. The most rapidly changing area is in the northern Republic of Congo, where the rate of road construction roughly quadrupled between 1976–90 and 2000–02.

        <h1 class="Atlantic"> Atlantic Forest/Gran Chaco</h1>
        <p class="info5">The Gran Chaco, two thirds of which lies in Argentina (130 million acres), is one of the most stressed eco-regions in Latin America. The Chaco’s massive forests harbor incredibly rich ecosystems that help the planet mitigate climate change whilst sheltering unique vegetation and wildlife including 3,400 plant species, 500 bird species, 150 mammals, 120 reptiles and some 100 amphibians. As their natural habitat is being destroyed, many of these species are in danger of disappearing, such as the giant anteater, the armadillo and the tapir. Many factors have contributed to turning South America’s tropical dry forests and savannas into major agricultural expansion frontiers, particularly regarding soybean and beef production. They include rising agricultural commodity prices, an increasing integration of South American countries into world markets, favorable climatic conditions, the availability of cheap land and labor, as well as increasing forest protection in the Amazon.The Chaco woodlands have been gradually replaced with cropland and ranches over the past several decades, but it’s disappearing even faster in recent years. From 2010 to 2012, for example, Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia—the three countries that share most of the Chaco—lost native vegetation at an average rate of more than an acre per minute. BA converted garage in Asuncion, Paraguay, seems an unlikely headquarters for the crusade to save one of Earth’s last great wilderness expanses. But in a cluttered and fluorescent-lit room, three geographic information systems (GIS) analysts are hunched over their computer screens searching satellite maps for signs of fresh deforestation in South America’s Gran Chaco forest, doing the best they can. “The Chaco is one of the most unknown remaining wildernesses on our planet,” says Alberto Yanosky, the activist in charge of those analysts. The problem though, is that “we’re losing the Chaco faster than scientists can study it.”y 2030, the Gran Chaco is projected to lose millions of additional acres of native vegetation.
